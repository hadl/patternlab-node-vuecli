# patternlab-node-vuecli
My first try to make patternlab node with Twig-PHP, Vue-Cli-Service and Webpack work together.

Thank you, https://github.com/Comcast/patternlab-edition-node-webpack for your inspiration!!!


# Note
**This repo is for personal use.**

Please, keep that in mind if you are nerdy enough and going to use it - who knows :)

The complete process is coupled to the Vue-Cli-Service - this is not a Webpack only wrapper for Patternlab.
