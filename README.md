# patternlab-node-vuecli
PatternLab node with Twig-PHP, Vue-Cli-Service and Webpack work together.

# Note
**This repo is for personal use.**

Please, keep that in mind if you are nerdy enough and going to use it - who knows :)

The complete process is coupled to the Vue-Cli-Service - this is not a Webpack only wrapper for Patternlab.
